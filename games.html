				This game/app allows users to build structures out of shapes. There are three shapes available: Wall, Floor, and Cyclinder. You can not only place these shapes, but vcan also move and edit the colour of them.
				You can rotate the walls as they are the only shapes that would benefit from having a rotate feature, and they can be rotated when being placed or being moved. You can move around with the camera, the camera 
				controls are in the top left corner of the screen. Shapes will also snap into place when placing on another shape (however this feature can be a little buggy, snap works better when zoomed in), and finally there 
				is a menu that you can open with the ESC key that will allow you to quit the application (this menu can be closed using the X button).

			<p class="wow bounceInRight" data-wow-delay="2s">
				This game demo was a personal project which I designed and developed myself. This was made using the Unity game engine which uses the programming landscape C#, Photoshop was also
				used to create the assets used for this game.
			</p>
			<p class="wow bounceInRight" data-wow-delay="2s">This game is a small demo of a puzzle game I made which gives the player puzzles that work with colour. The player controls a white block which pushes
			blocks of other colours around the level, and to complete the level the player needs to push these blocks unto pads of the same colour. There are objects in the level that can chnage the colour of a block 
			or swap the colour of two pads. Some levels will also have doors which need to be opened by completing one or two pads. This game does also save the levels that you complete, as you have to unlock the levels 
			by completing earlier levels. To learn the game there are tutorial levels that teach the player the core mechanics that can be seen in the levels themsleves.</p>

			<p class="wow bounceInRight" data-wow-delay="2s">
				<strong>Nominated for BCS Innovation Award during my time at the University of Hertfordshire!</strong>
				This was a game project that I made for the Final Project assignment for my third and final year at the University of Hertfordshire. This was made from sratch using
				the Unity game engine and was coded in the language C#.
			</p>
			<p class="wow bounceInRight" data-wow-delay="2s">This project was first planned and experimented with in the Project Planning Module in the first semester of the third year, then after the project was planned
			the actual artfact was built in the second semester. My project was to make a roguelike game that offered some solutions to three main problems that I found in existing roguelike games through project research.
			These problems where: Poor Difficulty Balancing, No Clear End Goals, and Missing Save Features.</p>
			<p class="wow bounceInRight" data-wow-delay="2s">The Download Game button will download a zip containing all the game files needed to run this game, and once extracted all you need to do is run the 
			Roguelike.exe file to play the game. The Download Project Report will download the report tbat was written for this Final Project for a more detailed walkthrough of the project itself.</p>

			<p class="wow bounceInRight" data-wow-delay="2s">
				This counting app was made as an educational game for my Mobile Computing assignment, this module helped teach me not only how to develop apps but also how to design them. I used Android Studio to develop this 
				as that was the IDE I was learning in the Mobile Comnputing module. This app contains two levels, the 1st level includes addition and the second level includes substraction, both levels have sound effects and vibration 
				(which can be turned on or off in the settings), and also has dragable rockets so the user can drag rockets around the screen when counting to help solve each problem.

			<img class="wow bounceInLeft" data-wow-delay="1s" src="Images/gamebasics.png" alt="wave game demo screenshot"></img>
			<p class="wow bounceInLeft" data-wow-delay="2s">
				This game was made from scratch in Java using Eclipse using a YouTube tutorial, this project allowed me to learn more about the back end/inner workings
				for games that you don't need to worry about within game engines as the engine handles that for you.
			</p>
			<p class="wow bounceInLeft" data-wow-delay="2s">
				This game was made by following a YouTube tutorial while commenting and making additions along the way to make sure the knowledge I had acquired stuck with me
				in some way. The game is a simple Wave Game with multiple waves of enemies and a boss at the end, but as there's only one level and not much else it's more akin to a demo of a game than a full game. This
				taught me about how game loops are developed in games and how they are used to create functionality and mechanics that the player can use while also developing in game time that passes regardless of player
				input.
