					However I have also made a game using Java which allowed me to create a game from scratch, meaning I had to learn how to create a game loop
					and develop how the game is played and run within that loop. I did this using a tutorial online which helped me learn more about developing games and the back end functionality
					that helps keeps games running which are pre-developed for you in game engines like Unity.

					A game I made with the Unity engine for my Final Project during my 3rd year at the University of Hertfordshire. This project was to make a Roguelike game that offered solutions to three
					big problems thats persisted in a lot of Roguelike games that exist which include: Not having a Save Feature, Poor Difficulty Balancing, and Little to No Clear End Goals. To do this I 
					planned the project in the Project Planning module the first semester along with doing some experimentation on the implementation of all the planned mechanics, and in the second semester
					I developed the project along with a project report that I handed in for the assignment.

				<h1 class="wow bounceInLeft">Websites</h1>
				<p class="wow bounceInLeft" data-wow-delay="1s">I create my websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP from scratch using the Notepad++ text editor. This portfolio was also created this way.</p>
				<p class="wow bounceInLeft" data-wow-delay="1s">
					I learnt to create websites ever since my week placement at Lumesse and continued to learn and develop my design and development skills as I created more sites. For university I had a placement
					year at eArcu which was for a year where I worked in the creative development team which allowed me to learn more about the technical aspects of creating sites, but I also gained experience on
					working with a team to create and maintain sites while also learning a little about the back-end development for websites and how its useful for developers who make loads of different websites
					and host them.
				</p>
				<p class="wow bounceInLeft" data-wow-delay="1s">
					I also gained a good amount of experience doing freelance work for a client who wanted a website created for their buisness. Not only did I have to create the site, but I had to communicate
					with the client with the progress of the site and I had to make changes and such where appropriate using the feedback I recieved from the client.

				<p id="web-text" class="wow bounceInRight" data-wow-delay="2s">
					This image shows the freelance website I made for the client. This was done from scratch using Notepad++ and the langauges mentioned earlier in this section. This site includes all the pages and 
					features the client wanted along with proper mobile responsivity for users veiwing the sites with smaller screens, this portfolio also has this feature. This site has not been marked as finished
					and fully hosted by the client yet as I am waiting approval from them to say everything looks good before the site goes live through their chosen hosting service.

					I first learnt how to code at a work experience placement during my time at secondary school, there I learnt website development. Since then i've learnt loads more programming languages, 
					like: Java, Python, C#, and C++. When I found game engines it increased my love for development, and I quickly got suck into engines like Unity. Each game I've developer and developed myself while also making the assets 
					in Photoshop or Blender depending on if the game was 2D or 3D. As someone who loves to develop and design games I have multiple folders on my PC which all contain various plans, test assets, and demos for each idea. 
					As I've continued to grow as a programmer through; work, university, and personal projects. I've learnt about so much more about good coding practices, and also learnt more about what makes solutions not only usuable and accessible to the average user, 
					but also what makes them fun and innovative in their own right.
